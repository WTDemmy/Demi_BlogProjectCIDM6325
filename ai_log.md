## 📖 Reflection Summary (Early Notes)
AI tools like ChatGPT have significantly accelerated the setup and debugging process.  
However, reliance on AI requires careful verification of:
- Correct syntax and context alignment with Django 5.2+
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.2)
- Role-based permission logic and database relationships
